Types of variables in Java with respect to their scope:
    There are 3 types of variables in Java with respect to their scope.
    1. Local 2. Instance 3. Static

Local Variable:
    Local variable are called If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop, if-condition.

Up-Side of a Local Variable:
    1.They exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
    2.Other programs on our computer can use that memory.

Down-Side of a Local Variable:
    1.Their scope is very limited, we can access them only within the block in which they are created not outside.

When to use a Local Variable:
    Use it over instance variable whenever it is possible.

Instance Variable:
    Instance variable are called variables that are written inside a class but outside a block of code.

Up-Side of a Instance Variable:
    1.We can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class.

Down-Side of a Instance Variable:
    1.They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.

When to use a Instance Variable:
    1.When we need to share a value between two or more methods.
    2.When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects can have a
    different value for that variable.

Static Variable:
    Static variable are called an instance variable with a static keyword.

Up-Side of a Static Variable:
    1.We can share data across the objects with the help of static variable.

Down-Side of a Static Variable:
    1.They occupy the memory for the longest

When to use a Static Variable:
    1.When we want to share something across all the methods.

====================================================================================================================
Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    These are only applicable to instance or static variable not to local variable.

    There are 4 types of access levels and 3 access modifier keywords.
    1.Private - most restricted one - it can be used only in the class specifically mentioned - use it always -
              UPSIDE: it is the most secured one - DOWNSIDE:Restricted so cant access anywhere else
    2.Protected
    3.Default - Automatically access when no keyword is used - used within the same package -
    4.Public - used all over any package or class within the project - you need to import it

    *We can have only one public class in a file that matches the name of the file.
