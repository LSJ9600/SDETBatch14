Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    These are only applicable to instance or static variable not to local variable.

    There are 4 types of access levels and 3 access modifier keywords.
    1.Private - most restricted one - it can be used only in the class its mentioned in - use this keyword always -
              UPSIDE: it is the most secured one - DOWNSIDE:Restricted so cant access anywhere else
    2.Default - Automatically access when no keyword is used - used within the same package -
    3.Public - used all over any package or class within the project - you need to import it - usually the class
               itself and method are declared as public
    4.Protected - can be access outside of package as well but only in the class that have parent-child relationship

 *NOTE: If we are inside a same class we can call a method inside another method by just writing its name.
        But we need to take care that these methods are both either static or non-static.
